#### 1. How do I update my schedule and register for working sessions?

  1. Take a look at the schedule and make a note of the sessions you're interested in attending
  
  2. Visit your profile page, i.e. https://open-security-summit.org/participant/toreon/sebastien-deleersnyder/.

  3. Scroll to the bottom of your page and click 'edit this page.'
  
  4. Enter your desired sessions below the 'sessions' using the following format
{{< highlight yaml >}}
sessions:
  - CISO Ask Me Anything (AMA)
  - Making Online Gaming Safer for Children
{{< /highlight >}}

If you have any difficulties in updating your schedule, please reach out on slack in the #oss-helpdesk channel.


#### 2. I don't have a profile page, how do I register as a participant on GitHub?

There are two types of participants - Onsite and Remote.

- To register as a remote participant:

   Please make a copy of the [remote participant template]({{< ref "/participant-remote/_template-remote.md" >}}) and save it in the same folder (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2018/tree/master/content/participant-remote). Fill in your details there.

- To register as an onsite participant:

   Please make a copy of the [participant template]({{< ref "/participant/_template.md" >}}) and save it in the same folder (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2018/tree/master/content/participant).

If you are going to contribute to a working session, it makes sense to fork the repo and push your changes (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2019).
