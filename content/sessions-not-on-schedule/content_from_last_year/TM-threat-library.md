## WHY

When creating a threat model there are a variation of thechniques that we use
to define the threats. A threat library (threat catalogue) helps identifying threats that can be applied to the model.
There is a beginning made with the OWASP Cloud Security, but that is focussed to just cloud.

## What

Create an threat library.
