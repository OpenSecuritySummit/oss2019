A take-off session for all participants that want to contribute to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide project, but are not sure what to do yet during this week or after.

## What

- Introduction into the current state of the MSTG.
  - [Issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues)
  - [Milestones](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/milestones)
  - [Project Page](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects)
- Release process.
