## WHY

Friendly get-together (possibly over lunch) to talk and exchange
experience about the OWASP Juice Shop.

## What

quirks and bugs with you to the open discussion! Some ideas others might be particularly interested in:

* Which is your favorite hacking challenge and why?
* How are you using Juice Shop in your company/university/...?
* Are you using the "vanilla" theme or your own corporate theme?
* What experience have you made with running a CTF on the Juice Shop?
* ...
