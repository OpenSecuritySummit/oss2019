description  : Refactoring the categories and difficulty ratings of the OWASP Juice Shop challenges

## WHY

The Juice Shop offers 85+ hacking challenges spread across 6
difficulty levels. It is time to review their categories and difficulty ratings for overall consistency and possible improvements.

## What

* Discuss the need for more (or less?) challenge categories
  * Map to additional existing vulnerability catalogs
* Discuss the need for more (or less?) difficulty levels
  * Define criteria to map challenges to difficulties more easily (e.g. _"Scripting needed?"_ or _"Multi-step attack required?"_)
  * Map the existing challenge to the aligned difficulty levels
