## Why

Develop new features and hacking challenges, beta-test those new
challenges and improve the OWASP Juice Shop project across the board.

## What

* _Builders_ work on functionality, bugfixes, new challenges,
  translations, documentation etc.
* _Breakers_ try to solve challenges, help fine-tune them and might even
  write some hints/solutions
* _Defenders_ use their own tools against the Juice Shop to see what
  they might miss and get ideas how to close gaps

## Outcomes

This working session can result in e.g.

* PRs being merged into the project's repositories on GitHub
* translations being improved on CrowdIn
* the companion guide eBook being extended and improved

The results of each day will be accumulated into the Release Notes for
the release to be published at the
[Juice Shop Release Night](/tracks/owasp-juice-shop/working-sessions/juice-shop-release-night/).
