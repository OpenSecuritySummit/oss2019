OWASP Testing Guide provides a “low level” Penetration Testing guide describing tools & techniques used for testing the most common application security vulnerabilities. The Guide has become a de facto standard to perform Web Application Penetration Testing.

## When

## Why

Individuals and companies around the world are increasingly adopting OWASP Testing Guide as a standard for performing Application Penetration Testing. Hence, it is vital to maintain an updated project that represents the state of the art for WebAppSec. This Working Session aims to discuss and define the scope and content of OWASP Testing Guide v5.

## What

There are usually a common pattern to detect and test for security vulnerabilities. These patterns don't differ from application to application nor do we have hundreds of ways to detect such. Thus, OWASP Testing Guide aims standardize and list a common procedure to detect and test for most common web application security vulnerabilities. Keeping a standard up-to-date with new class of vulnerabilities and tools is a step toward right direction and help security professionals do the job right.

## Outcomes

All sections in v4 reviewed
Project aligned with the ASVS and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
A more readable guide created that eliminates sections that are not useful
New testing techniques inserted

## Who

The target audiences for this Working Session are:
- Security professionals
- Security aware individual and companies
