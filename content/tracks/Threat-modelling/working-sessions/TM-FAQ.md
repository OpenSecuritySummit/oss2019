## Why

We all love the threat model slack channel. There is a lot of useful information being presented. We need to somehow persist that in a more searchable format, preferably on the OWASP TM wiki pages.

## What

 - How are we going to persist this data?
 - Who is going to reduce the backlog?
 
## Outcomes

A description on how the data from Slack can be peristed in the form of a series of FAQ.
