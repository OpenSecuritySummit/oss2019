## Why & What

Feedback from the industry is needed for the researcher in academia. In the previous sessions Kim explained the research that was performed at the University of Leuven. This session is where members from the industry can comment on the work done, how usable this seems and give pointers to where research could be done. 

## Outcomes

Remarks and comments on the usability of the reasearch presented.
Input for the University of Leuven on future topics for reasearch.
