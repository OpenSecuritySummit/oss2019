## Why

Creating your first threat model can be a daunting task. A good way to start is with a simple threat model and then increment until the threat model is "good enough".

## What
Irene Michlin will introduce a proven method for incremental threat modeling. We will discuss any questions and remarks that might come up from the participants.

## Outcomes

This Working Session will publish a document describing a generic way to implement incremental threat modeling.
