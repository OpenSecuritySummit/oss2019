## WHY

This is your summit! Whatever it is you want to work on, we will do. We decide at the beginning of the session what the topic will be and work on that.
This session is meant to go deeper into one of the session from Moday. 

This will either be the TM SDL or the lightweight privacy threat modeling. This session is sheduled so that the organisers and main participants of these two sessions are present.

## What

Bring a good idea and get things done :-)
We will vote at the beginning of the session on which topic we will work.

## Outcomes

A description of the topic and the work done as well as the next steps.
